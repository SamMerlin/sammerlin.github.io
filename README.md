# This is a modular version of supreme games.


 The goal of this project is to provide an easy way of self hosting. The api things on upstream are confusing so I plan to remove or change anything dependent on it.

 The games are in the `sg` folder.

 I also aim to create something like emulatorjs.org code editor section that lets you select things that will combine into your sites files.

 # Reporting bugs
 Before reporting problems related to the games, check the related compatibility sheet! Also report any game issues to main branch and not here.
