# A note on emulators
Hi, I'm MastrCheef99, providing you most of the emulators on this sbte. Blue222 works on the technical side of things like hosting emulator.js straight on our site. I will soon be adding a fork of the demo site so you can play your own games. Maybe it's for games I forgot to add (though you just have to request me to add them) but this is mostly for PS1 and N64 games since the file sizes are mostly too big for github. I don't want to full on host the entirety of those catalogs on google drive but you can dm me on discord (i lost my numbers so mastrcheef99) and I can help you download the files you need or rip your own files (recommended). UPDATE: Uh it's kind of hard and I'm definetly not lazy.
Shit that was a big note
# How to self host
This repository is meant to act simply as a file server and uses other subdomains for proxy and api. The code expects you to host the api at api.linkToThis to this and the proxy at uuvv.linkToThis. You can change the api link in /js/main.js by changing the api variable. To change the proxy simply go to all occurences of var proxURL = and change it
